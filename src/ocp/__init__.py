"""Optimized Convex Potential (OCP) research code.

This package is intentionally small and modular:
- potentials: convex potentials with closed-form gradients
- losses: potential-based losses
- data: dataset builders / loaders
- train: training and evaluation loops
- experiments: runnable entrypoints
